DA4U | Powerbi Emergency Admissions Report

This Power BI report was built to explore and visualize emergency hospital admissions using a sample dataset. It’s a quick but structured report that shows how limited, realistic data can still reveal meaningful trends about patient flow, departmental workload, and admission timelines.

Report Structure

The report is divided into two key sections, both using filters for calendar date and admitting department to allow dynamic exploration.
I used Power Query to transform and clean the data before displaying it.

This section provides a high-level view of all patients arriving at the emergency department. It includes:

Total patient count
List of patients details
Patient distribution by day and time
Filters to explore trends by date and department

This gives a sense of patient volume and how demand fluctuates over time.
