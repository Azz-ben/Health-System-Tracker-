DA4U | Powerbi Emergency Admissions Report

This Power BI report was built to explore and visualize emergency hospital admissions using a sample dataset. It’s a quick but structured report that shows how limited, realistic data can still reveal meaningful trends about patient flow, departmental workload, and admission timelines.
Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following fields:

Visit Date
Time before Admission
Department
Admission Status (Admitted or Not Admitted)
Gender

While simplified and anonymized, this data mimics a real emergency intake scenario.
